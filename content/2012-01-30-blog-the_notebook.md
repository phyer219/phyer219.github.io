想来，寒假不能虚度。便每天晚上看部电影吧。共七天。

《THE NOTEBOOK》很疯狂。结局也很令人满意。

感受多了，一下子反而不知道该怎么说了。爱，可以创造奇迹，要坚持。

oung Noah: My Dearest Allie. I couldn't sleep last night because I know that it's over between us. I'm not bitter anymore, because I know that what we had was real. And if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives, I'll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent the summer beneath the trees, learning from each other and growing in love. The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds, and that's what you've given me. That's what I hope to give to you forever. I love you. I'll be seeing you.

诺亚：“我最亲爱的艾丽。昨晚我彻夜难眠，因为我知道我们的爱情就这样结束了。我痛苦至极，因为我知道我们是真心相爱。如果在将来我们能在新生活中重逢，我会欣喜的朝你微笑，会想起我们在树下的夏日时光、对彼此的了解和渐入佳境的爱。极致之爱能唤醒灵魂，它让我们追求更多，让我们心火熊熊、凝神静气，那就是你给予我的。那也是我希望给予你的。我爱你。再见了。”是开头老年Noah的话：

I am no one special,just a common man with common thoughts.

I've lived a common life.

There are no monuments dedicated to me.And my name will soon be forgotten.

But in one respect,I 've succeeded as gloriously as anyone whoever lived.

I've loved another with all my heart and soul and for me that has always been enough.

Noah对Allie 表白的时候：

And when I see something that I like,I gotta ha--I love it.

I go--I mean,I go crazy for it.

I can be fun,if you want..pensive,uh,smart,uh,superstitious,brave.And uh...

I can be light on my feet.I could be whatever you want.

You just tell me what you want and I'll be that for you.

孩子们来医院时，劝说Noah回家：

Look,guys,that's My sweetheart in there.

I 'm not leaving her.This is my home now.Your mother is my home.

当Noah来到Allie病房时：

Allie：“What's gonna happen when I can't remember anything any more?

What will you do?“

Noah:"I'll be here.I'll never leave you.”

And Allie asked Noah:"Do you think that our love can create miracles?"

Noah:"Yes,I do.That's what brings you back to me each time."

Allie：“Do you think our love could take us away together?”

Noah:"I think our love can do anything we want it to."

And for the last time Noah kissed Allie and saying"I love you. "

Noah:"I love you,Allie.Goodnight.I'll be seeing you. "
